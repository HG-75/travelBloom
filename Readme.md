# TravelBloom

Welcome to **TravelBloom**, a travel exploration website designed to inspire and help users discover breathtaking destinations across the globe. Whether you're seeking a serene beach getaway, exploring historical temples, or planning a cultural trip to a foreign country, **TravelBloom** will provide personalized recommendations for your next adventure.

## Features

- **Search for Destinations**: You can search for various destinations based on keywords like "beach", "temple", or "country".
- **Browse Results**: After searching, the website will display a list of related destinations with beautiful images to give you inspiration.
- **Alert for 'Book Now' Button**: The "Book Now" button on the homepage currently shows an alert indicating the feature is under development and will be available soon.

## How It Works

1. **Homepage**: The homepage introduces TravelBloom, showcasing a "Book Now" button that currently triggers an alert, stating that the functionality is being developed.
2. **Search Functionality**: On the homepage, there’s a search bar where users can type keywords like "beach", "temple", or "country".
3. **Search Results**: The website will show matching destinations in the results section below the search bar. For instance, if you search for a "beach," you’ll see results like Maldives Beach or Bora Bora Beach with corresponding images.
4. **Clear Results**: There is a "Clear" button that resets the search bar and clears the displayed results.

## Technologies Used
